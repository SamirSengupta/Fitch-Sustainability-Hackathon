🌿 EcoPredict: AI-Driven Emissions Estimation

🏆 FitchGroup Codeathon '25 Submission

Challenge: Enhanced Emissions Estimates for ESG Data Completeness

Team: SamCodeMan

📖 Overview

EcoPredict is a production-ready web application designed to estimate Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions scores for non-reporting companies. By leveraging auxiliary financial data (Revenue, Firm Size) and partial ESG metrics (Social & Governance scores), our model fills critical gaps in ESG datasets, enabling more accurate investment decision-making.

🚀 Key Features

High Accuracy: Achieved 96% R² on validation data.

Imputation Logic: Reverse-engineers missing Environmental data from aggregate ESG scores.

Production UI: Professional Bootstrap 5 interface.

Scalable Backend: Built on Flask API architecture.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Flask

ML Engine: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest)

Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (Fetch API)

Data: Pandas/NumPy
